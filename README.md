# 🔥 Smart Fire Alarm System 🚨

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a smart fire alarm system designed to detect fires at their early stages and take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of building occupants and minimize property damage. The system includes several advanced features to enhance fire safety and response. This project is required for a course in Software Project Management, focusing on the application of project management principles in a real-world context.

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **🕵️‍♂️ Early Detection and Notification:**
   - The system can detect fires in their early stages, even if they are minor.
   - It sounds an alarm to inform residents to evacuate and directs them to the nearest emergency exit.

2. **🔥 Fire Type Differentiation and Response:**
   - The system distinguishes between different types of fires and sprays the appropriate chemical to combat the fire.

3. **🌬️ Air Quality Management:**
   - Connected to the building's HVAC system, it purifies the air from smoke until emergency services arrive.

4. **📡 Automated Emergency Communication:**
   - The system automatically sends a signal to the civil defense department, providing the fire's location and details without human intervention.

## 🎯 Project Goals and Requirements

### 🏆 Goals
- Develop and implement a smart fire alarm system in public buildings within one year.
- Ensure the system meets the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.

### 📋 Requirements
- The system should create a risk map to guide victims to exit points.
- It must calculate the risk level and generate alerts.
- It should send notifications to fire stations and data to related systems, such as HVAC and sprinkler systems.

## 🚧 Risk Management

### 🛠️ Identified Risks and Mitigation Plans
- **💸 Risk of Increased Sensor Shipment Costs:**
  - Mitigation: Accept the risk and allocate additional funds to cover the increased costs, ensuring the system's quality and robustness are not compromised.

## 📅 Project Milestones and Deliverables

- **📦 Deliverables:**
  - System Requirements Specification (SRS)
  - User Manual

- **🏁 Milestones:**
  - Completion of SRS
  - Alpha and Beta testing phases
  - Final deployment and user training

## 🔚 Conclusion

The Smart Fire Alarm System project is designed to significantly enhance fire safety in buildings by providing early detection, appropriate response, and automated communication with emergency services. By meeting stringent safety standards and addressing potential risks effectively, the project aims to protect lives and property efficiently.
