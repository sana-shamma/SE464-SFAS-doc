# 🔥 Smart Fire Alarm System 🚨

## Project Overview 🌐

This project aims to develop a smart fire alarm system designed to detect fires at their early stages and take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of building occupants and minimize property damage. The system includes several advanced features to enhance fire safety and response. This project is required for a course in Software Project Management, focusing on the application of project management principles in a real-world context.

###  Key Features🌟

1. **Early Detection and Notification:🕵️‍♂️**
   - The system can detect fires in their early stages, even if they are minor.
   - It sounds an alarm to inform residents to evacuate and directs them to the nearest emergency exit.

2. **Fire Type Differentiation and Response:🔥**
   - The system distinguishes between different types of fires and sprays the appropriate chemical to combat the fire.

3. **Air Quality Management:🌬️**
   - Connected to the building's HVAC system, it purifies the air from smoke until emergency services arrive.

4. **Automated Emergency Communication:📡**
   - The system automatically sends a signal to the civil defense department, providing the fire's location and details without human intervention.

### Project Goals and Requirements🎯 

####  Goals🏆
- Develop and implement a smart fire alarm system in public buildings within one year.
- Ensure the system meets the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.

#### Requirements📋 
- The system should create a risk map to guide victims to exit points.
- It must calculate the risk level and generate alerts.
- It should send notifications to fire stations and data to related systems, such as HVAC and sprinkler systems.

### Project Milestones and Deliverables📅

- **Deliverables:📦**
  - System Requirements Specification (SRS)
  - User Manual

- **Milestones:🏁**
  - Completion of SRS
  - Alpha and Beta testing phases
  - Final deployment and user training

## Some Techniques were Applied from Project Management Course: 🛠️⚙️

### 1.Scope Management Plan 📋
- **SMART techniques** for defining scope.
- Prototyping as **requirements elicitation techniques** with a requirement traceability matrix (RTM). 
- **Power Interest Grid** for stakeholder analysis.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** for schedule planning.

### 2.Schedule Management Plan ⏳
- **Function Points (FP)** and **COCOMO** as estimation techniques for schedule management.
- **Task Dependency** with different types: start-to-start, finish-to-finish, and finish-to-start.
- Identify the **Critical Path** .
- **Gantt Chart** for presenting project activity. 

### 3.Cost Management Plan 💰
- Define **Direct and Indirect Costs** of the Project.
- **Cost Element Structure (CES)** that precisely defines the cost items to consider in the project.

### 4.Risk Management Plan 🔍
- Risk Management Life Cycle: 
   - Risk identification by using **brainstorming**, **fishbone diagram**, and **if/then statements**.
   - Analysis and prioritization of risks by using **probability and impact matrix** to assess and prioritize risks.
   - Development of **mitigation plans**: avoidance plan, minimizing plan, transfer plan, and acceptance plan.

### 5.Measure Project Progress 📈
- **Earned Value Analysis Techniques with supporting WBSs** to track both schedule and cost of the project.

## 🔚 Conclusion

The Smart Fire Alarm System project is designed to significantly enhance fire safety in buildings by providing early detection, appropriate response, and automated communication with emergency services. By meeting stringent safety standards and addressing potential risks effectively, the project aims to protect lives and property efficiently.
